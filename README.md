# obsidian-templates
Templates I use with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

Copy the Templates folder to the vault.

Uses [Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/introduction.html) so you'll need that installed for some Templates to work.

Some templates are for specific plugins (e.g. Pocket) so you'll want those plugins installed for them to be useful.
